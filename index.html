        <p><em>Student at <strong><a href="http://www.dypatil.edu/mumbai/rait/"> Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology </a></strong>.</em></p>
        <p>I am presently pursuing an engineering degree with
          an emphasis on electronics. Because of my scientific
          background, I have a strong interest in technology
          and am well-versed in it. I've done programming in
          Python, C++, and HTML, as well as data analysis in
          SQL and Python, and I've developed and worked on
          digital arts and design. I've completed an internship in
          machine learning. Python is my preferred
          programming language. Creative writing, Illustrator,
          Photography, and Graphic Editing are some of my
          other abilities. Learning new things and creating
          creative work are two of my favorite pastimes.</p>
